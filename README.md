This project is based off the battleship game. 

How to play:
To play, select 1 player (2 players currently doesn't work). On your left will be your board, on your right will be the opponent's board. First, you need to place your
ships, place the start position, then the end position of your ship and then click the 'place ship'. Do this repeatedly until you no longer want to place ships, then press Start Game. You take turns attacking against the cpu by clicking the CPU's board and then clicking 'Confirm Attack'.
