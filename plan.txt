Focus: restart the game when all of one's players ships are sunk:
* in attackDomManager
+ import the dropShips.js file to attackDomManager
+ inside endGame() {
    + at the end of the function, get a reference to dropShips.js()
    + call dropShips playerCount function
    + call dropShips clearBoards function with the false value
}
