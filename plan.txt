Focus: change the function that causes the board.js to recieve an attack:
* attackDomManager.js 
- delete the line defendingPlayer.ourBoard.recieveAttack 
+ if the defendingPlayer is player1
{
  + call defendingPlayer board's recieveAttack function
  + call player1.swapTurn()
  + call player2.swapTurn()
}
if the defendingPlayer is player2
{

}
psuedo code:
// attackDomManager \\
