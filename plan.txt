Focus: make the button confirm the attack:
* in index.js 
- after the attackManager is instantiated, querySelect the confirm Attack Button (its class is
confirmAttackBtn)
- add an event listener to the button where click is what the button will listen for.
- the function the button will call when clicked is the attackDomManagers findUnconfirmedAttacks()
function.
