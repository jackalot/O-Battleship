Focus: adding a button that submits the attack onto the board:
* in attackDomManager
{
- inside attackDomManager, a function called findUnconfirmedAttacks() {
  // this will find the unconfirmed attack and it will get the coordinates from that unconfirmed attack
  - query select a class with the name unconfirmedAttack
  - find the box that was found and store its id
  - store the 1 or 2 in the boxes id in where it says "P1Box" or "P2Box" as a variable
  - store the seperate coordinates from the boxes id where it says "-3-5" as two seperate variables
  - the above two variables will be strings, so then make them integers using parseInt
  - after the seperate coordinates have been parsed, store them into one coordinate object
}
// most of this is basically updateDomBoard's recieveAttack function
- in recieveAttack()
  {
    - parameters { coordinate, defendingPlayer}
    - first, store a reference to [ a function we need to plan out inside attackDomManager]
    - then store a reference to the defendingPlayer, their board, and their recieveAttack function
  }
}
