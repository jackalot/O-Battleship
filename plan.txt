Focus: change the approach of how we make the players take turns attacking eachother:
reason: the current approach lags the page each time
* in style.css, 
- add a class named unconfirmed-Attack
{
    - it will have the background yellow
}
* in updateDomBoard.js
{
    - inside updateDomBoard, a new function called unconfirmedAttack()
    {
       - its parameters are: { temporaryBox }
       - temporaryBox will then have the class "unconfirmed-Attack" added to it.
       - we then query select the class ".gameStatus" and set it to a variable
       - then change the gameStatus text content to be along the lines of "myPlayer.playerName confirm attack"
    }
    - in the function checkBox {

    }
}
psuedo code:
// style.css \\
.undconfirmed-Attack {
    background-color: yellow
}
