Focus: after an attack is confirmed, the visible boards will swap:
* attackDomManager.js
- in the recieveDomAttack () {
- remove the variable result but don't remove the function call to the defending player
- remove the lines from the console.log() to the second if statement.
}
psuedo code:
function recieveDomAttack(coordinate, defendingPlayer, domBox) {
    defendingPlayer.ourBoard.recieveAttack(coordinate);
    const gameStatus = document.querySelector('.gameStatus');
    gameStatus.textContent = "Click on a square to attack that board, then click below to confirm you're attack! ";
  }
