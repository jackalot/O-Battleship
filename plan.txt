Focus: make the cpu attack when its the cpu's turn:
* in attackDomManager.js {
  + in the function swapVisibility() {
    + before the visibility is swapped, check if player 2 doesnt have the name CPU before continuing to the
    rest of the function { rest of the function }
    + if player 2 does have the name CPU {
      
    }
  }
}
