Focus: after the ship has been placed, allow the ship to be displayed and more ships to be placed
* in dropships
+ inside dropship, a new function named revealBoard(){
  // helper function to confirmPlacedShips
}
psuedo code:
  function confirmPlacedShips() {
    const allUnconfirmedShips = findUnconfirmedShips();
    const unconfirmedCoordinates = getShipCoordinates(allUnconfirmedShips);
    const shipObject = createShipObject(unconfirmedCoordinates);
    ourPlayers.playerOne.ourBoard.placeShip(shipObject.startPoint, shipObject.endPoint);
  }
