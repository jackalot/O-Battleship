Focus: allowing players to place their own ships:
* make a new file, call it dropShips.js:
+ make it a factory function with an export modules like updateDomBoard.js
{
  + inside dropShip(). make a new function called clearBoards()
  {
    + parameters { playerCount }
    + if playerCount is one
    {
      + querySelect the playerOne board 
      + then get each element inside the playerOne board with the class name 'box'
    }
  }
  + inside dropShip(), a new function called askPlayerCount() {
    + prompt the user how many player's will be playing, (for now we only have 1 player)
    + then parse the prompt as it will be a string
    + if the result of the prompt is 1
    {

    }
  }
}
psuedo code:
function dropShip() {
 function askPlayerCount() {
   const windowResult = Number(window.prompt('How many players will be playing? For one player, please type 1, for two players, please type 2', ''));
   const result = parseInt(windowResult);
   if(result === 1)
   {
     console.log(result);
   }
 }
}
module.exports = dropShip;
