Focus: make the cpu be able to attack corresponding grid items when a hit is found:
* inside player.js
{
  + inside sendRandomAttack() {
    + check if hitsFound has a length greater than 0, this means that there was a hit
    {

    }
}
psuedo code:
 function sendRandomAttack(playerAttacking) {
    const hitsFound = findHits(playerAttacking);
    console.log(hitsFound);
    if(hitsFound.length > 0)
    {

    }
    if(hitsFound.length === 0)
    {
      const coordinate = createRandomCoordinate(playerAttacking);
      console.log(coordinate);
    }
    return false;
  }
