Focus: adding a button that submits the attack onto the board:
* in attackDomManager
{
// most of this is basically updateDomBoard's recieveAttack function
- in recieveAttack()
  {
    - parameters { coordinate, defendingPlayer}
    - first, store a reference to [ a function we need to plan out inside attackDomManager]
    - then store a reference to the defendingPlayer, their board, and their recieveAttack function
  }
}
psuedo code:
