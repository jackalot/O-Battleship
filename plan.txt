Focus: call getAShipLayout after the player is done placing ships and start the game:
//getAShipLayout() properly places all the ships for the cpu and displays the ships,
// we just need to make it function when clicking the start game button
+ in askPlayerCount()
{
    + before the result is returned, if it equals 1 {
        
    }
}
psuedo code:
 function askPlayerCount() {
    const windowResult = Number(window.prompt('How many players will be playing? For one player, please type 1, for two players, please type 2', ''));
    // eslint-disable-next-line radix
    const result = parseInt(windowResult);
    return result;
  }
