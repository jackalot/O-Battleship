Focus: make the button confirm the attack:
* in index.js 
- after the attackManager is instantiated, querySelect the confirm Attack Button (its class is
confirmAttackBtn)
- add an event listener to the button where click is what the button will listen for.
- the function the button will call when clicked is the attackDomManagers findUnconfirmedAttacks()
function.
psuedo code: 
const playerOne = playerFile('player 1', 0);
const playerTwo = playerFile('CPU', 1);
//  console.log(playerOne.ourBoard);
//  console.log(playerTwo.ourBoard);
const attackManager = attackDomFile(playerOne, playerTwo, callItAgain);

const p1DomBoardManager = domBoardFile(playerOne, 'P1Box', callItAgain, playerTwo);
const p2DomBoardManager = domBoardFile(playerTwo, 'P2Box', callItAgain, playerOne);
