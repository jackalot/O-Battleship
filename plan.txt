Focus: change the approach of how we make the players take turns attacking eachother:
reason: the current approach lags the page each time
* in style.css, 
- add a class named unconfirmed-Attack
{
    - it will have the background yellow
}

psuedo code:
// style.css \\
.undconfirmed-Attack {
    background-color: yellow
}
