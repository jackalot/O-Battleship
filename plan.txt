Focus: make opponent player's board only display hit's, misses, and white spaces, aka hide ships:
* in updateDomBoard.js
{
    - in checkBox() {
       - on the if statement of shipResult, add an and statement that also checks that new variable
       hideShips is false
       - a new if statement that checks if shipResult === true and hideShips === true {

       }
    }
}
