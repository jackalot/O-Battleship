Focus:Fix the reference before defined bug:
- in player.js, instantiate our own updateDomBoard.js called domBoardManager
- in index.js, remove p1DomBoardManager and p2DomBoardManager
- in index.js, attackDomManager will get the domBoardManager's from playerOne.domBoardManager
and playerTwo.domBoardManager
