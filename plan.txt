Focus: start the game after ships are placed and the lone player presses startGame:
// the cpu has all of its ship layouts now, the start button calls getAShipLayout()
// thanks to askPlayerCount() having an event listener in that function.
+ import the attackDomManager
+ inside dropShip.js, a new function called startGame() {
    + call hideButton() on the following classes: "confirm-place-ships", "start", "Pass-Turn"
    + call displayButton on the following classes: "confirmAttackBtn"
    + call clear board with the value false
    + create instances of both players updateDomBoards, player 2 will have theirs hidden
    + update both player's boards
    + create an instance of the attackDomManager();
    + query select the confirmAttackBtn
    + add an event listener (() => {
        + add the attackDomManager.findUnconfirmedAttacks() function to confirmAttackBtn
    })
}
psuedo code:
 function startGame() {
     
 }
