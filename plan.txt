* in updateDomBoard.js
- in unconfirmedAttack (){
 - before any other previous attacks are queryselected, check if myPlayer.playerTurn equals 0
 {
     - then continue the function.
 }
}
* in attackDomManager.js
- in swapVisibility()
{
    - if defendingPlayer is equal to player1 {
        -call the player1.swapTurn() function
        -call the player2.swapTurn() function
    }
    - if defendingPlayer is equal to player2 {
        -call the player2.swapTurn() function
        -call the player1.swapTurn() function
