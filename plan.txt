Focus: make the cpu be able to attack corresponding grid items when a hit is found:
* inside player.js
{
  + inside player.js, a new function called createRandomCoordinate()
  {
    + parameters { playerAttacking }
    + make a variable called x, make it a random number between 0-10 (thanks to math.floor add 1 to remove the 1)
    + make a similar variable called y
    + turn the x and y variable into a coordinate object
  }
  + inside sendRandomAttack() {
    + check if hitsFound has a length greater than 0, this means that there was a hit
    + check if hits found has a length of 0, this means its our first attack
    {
      
    }
    + return if none of the above were true
  }
}
psuedo code:
function findHits(playerAttacking) {
  const hitsFound = [];
  if(playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords.length === 0)
  {
    for(let i = 0; i < playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords.length; i += 1)
    {
      if(playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords[i].coordType === 'Hit')
      {
        hitsFound.push(playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return hitsFound;
}
