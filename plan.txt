Focus: after the ship has been placed, allow the ship to be displayed and more ships to be placed

psuedo code:

  function revealBoard(currentPlayer, otherPlayer) {
    const domBoardManager = domBoardFile(currentPlayer, 'P1Box', otherPlayer, false);
    domBoardManager.sendNextCollumn();

    const allUnconfirmedShips = findUnconfirmedShips();
    const unconfirmedCoordinates = getShipCoordinates(allUnconfirmedShips);
    const shipObject = createShipObject(unconfirmedCoordinates);
    if(playerCount === 1)
    {
      ourPlayers.playerOne.ourBoard.placeShip(shipObject.startPoint, shipObject.endPoint);
      revealBoard(ourPlayers.playerOne, ourPlayers.playerTwo);
    }
  }
