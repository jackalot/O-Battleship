Focus: add a helper function to recieveDomAttack to make restarting the game easier:
* in attackDomManager.js
+ inside attackDomManager, there will be a function called endGame()
{
  + parameters{defendingPlayer}
  + add a querySelector to gameStatus
  + change the gameStatus textContent to `${defendingPlayer.playerName}, you lose! 
  All your battleships have been sunk! Play Again? Click the Play Again Button!`
  + if player1 has their ships hidden, call their swapHideShips function.
  + if player2 has their ships hidden, call their swapHideShips function.
}
- in the recieveDomAttack function (){
  - in the else section of sunkenResult, remove gameStatus and the textContent
  + replace it with calling endGame();
}
psuedo code:
 function recieveDomAttack(coordinate, defendingPlayer) {
    if (defendingPlayer === player1) {
      player2.sendAttack(player1, coordinate);
    }
    if (defendingPlayer === player2) {
      player1.sendAttack(player2, coordinate);
    }
    const sunkenResult = defendingPlayer.ourBoard.allShipsSunk();
    if (sunkenResult === false) {
      const gameStatus = document.querySelector('.gameStatus');
      gameStatus.textContent = "Click on a square to attack that board, then click below to confirm you're attack! ";
      swapVisibility(defendingPlayer);
    } else {
      const gameStatus = document.querySelector('.gameStatus');
      gameStatus.textContent = `${defendingPlayer.playerName}, you lose! All your battleships have been sunk!`;
    }
  }
