Focus: make the cpu be able to attack corresponding grid items when a hit is found:
* inside player.js
{
  + inside sendRandomAttack() {
    + check if hitsFound has a length greater than 0, this means that there was a hit
  }
}
psuedo code:
function findHits(playerAttacking) {
  const hitsFound = [];
  if(playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords.length === 0)
  {
    for(let i = 0; i < playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords.length; i += 1)
    {
      if(playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords[i].coordType === 'Hit')
      {
        hitsFound.push(playerAttacking.ourBoard.hitOrMissedCoords[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return hitsFound;
}
