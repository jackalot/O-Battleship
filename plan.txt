Focus:Fix the reference before defined bug:
- in player.js, instantiate our own updateDomBoard.js called domBoardManager
- in index.js, remove p1DomBoardManager and p2DomBoardManager
- in index.js, attackDomManager will get the domBoardManager's from playerOne.domBoardManager
and playerTwo.domBoardManager

psuedo Code:
---- in player.js ----
const playerFactory = (playerName, playerTurn) => {
  const ourBoard = boardFile({ x: 1, y: 1 }, { x: 10, y: 10 });
  const domBoardManager = domBoardFile(playerOne, 'P1Box', attackManager);
  ///the rest of the script
}
