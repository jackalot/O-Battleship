Focus: allowing players to place their own ships:
* make a new file, call it dropShips.js:
+ make it a factory function with an export modules like updateDomBoard.js
{
  + inside dropShip(), a new function called askPlayerCount() {
    + prompt the user how many player's will be playing, (for now we only have 1 player)
    + then parse the prompt as it will be a string
    + if the result of the prompt is 1
    {

    }
  }
}
psuedo code:
function dropShip() {

}
module.exports = dropShip;
