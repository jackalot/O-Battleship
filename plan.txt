Focus: after the ship has been placed, allow the ship to be displayed and more ships to be placed
* in dropships
+ import the file updateDOMBoard
+ inside dropship, a new function named revealBoard(){
  // helper function to confirmPlacedShips
  + parameters { currentPlayer, otherPlayer }
  + make an instance of updateDOMBoard from the file that was imported
  + call sendNextCollumn(); from updateDOMBoard
  + then call clearBoard with an argument of true

psuedo code:
  const domBoardFile = require('./updateDOMBoard');
  function clearBoard(currentPlayer, otherPlayer) {
    const domBoardManager = domBoardFile(currentPlayer, 'P1Box', otherPlayer, false);
    domBoardManager.sendNextCollumn();
  }
  function confirmPlacedShips() {
    const allUnconfirmedShips = findUnconfirmedShips();
    const unconfirmedCoordinates = getShipCoordinates(allUnconfirmedShips);
    const shipObject = createShipObject(unconfirmedCoordinates);
    ourPlayers.playerOne.ourBoard.placeShip(shipObject.startPoint, shipObject.endPoint);
    clearBoard(ourPlayers.playerOne, ourPlayers.playerTwo);
  }
