Focus: make the cpu be able to attack corresponding grid items when a hit is found:
* inside player.js
{
  + inside sendRandomAttack() {
    + check if hitsFound has a length greater than 0, this means that there was a hit
    {

    }
}
psuedo code:
 function sendRandomAttack(playerAttacking) {
    const hitsFound = findHits(playerAttacking);
    console.log(hitsFound);
    // if ships were hit, then try to find adjoining coordinates to that coordinates
    // in case it's a ship
    if (hitsFound.length > 0) {
      console.log('testingh');
    }
    // if no ships were harmed, fire a random attack at any coordinate
    if (hitsFound.length === 0) {
      const coordinate = createRandomCoordinate(playerAttacking);
      sendAttack(playerAttacking, coordinate);
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
